# ðŸŒŠ Water-Wise â€“ Geospatial Platform for Intelligent Water Management
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Water-Wise is an innovative web application developed as part of the Final Year Project in Computer Engineering at Universidade LusÃ³fona. The platform aims to support the efficient management of water resources, focusing on reservoirs, rivers, and agricultural zones, providing an integrated, visual, and predictive overview of the current hydrological situation.

By collecting and integrating both real-time and historical data (including satellite imagery, field measurements, and external APIs), the system offers dynamic visualizations, interactive dashboards, and personalized alerts based on machine learning models.
